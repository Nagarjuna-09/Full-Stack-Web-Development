    <h1>Nagarjuna Nathani</h1>
    <p><em><strong>Full Stack Web Developer</strong></em></p>
    <p>Hi, I'm Nagarjuna Nathani! I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science at Binghamton University in the
    United States. I completed my Bachelor of Technology degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering in India.
    I have had the opportunity to intern at TCS from January 2017 to May 2017 and work as a research engineer for four years
    at Hyundai R&D Center, India. During fall of 2022, I also did an internship at ThermoAi. I'm passionate about technology
    and love staying up to date with the latest trends. I'm a bit of a nerd, and I enjoy reading about new advancements in
    the tech industry.
    Outside of academics, I love playing cricket and following the sport. I'm also interested in startups and hope to start
    a company of my own someday.
    
    Currently, I'm actively seeking internship or full-time opportunities in the tech industry, and I'm excited to see where
    my career will take me.</p>
