    <h1>Nagarjuna Nathani </h1>
    <p><em><strong>Software Developer || Machine Learning Engineer || Full Stack Web Developer</strong></em></p>
    <p>Hi, I'm Nagarjuna Nathani! I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/"target="_blank">Binghamton University</a> 
        in the
        United States. I completed my Bachelor of Technology degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering in
        India.
        I have had the opportunity to intern at <a href="https://www.tcs.com/"target="_blank">TCS</a> from January 2017 to May 2017 and work as a research engineer for
        four years
        at <a href="https://hmie.in/"target="_blank">Hyundai R&D Center</a>, India. During fall of 2022, I also did an internship at <a href="https://thermoai.com/"target="_blank">ThermoAi</a>. I'm passionate about
        technology
        and love staying up to date with the latest trends. I'm a bit of a nerd, and I enjoy reading about new
        advancements in
        the tech industry.
        Outside of academics, I love playing cricket and following the sport. I'm also interested in startups and hope
        to start
        a company of my own someday.

        Currently, I'm actively seeking internship or full-time opportunities in the tech industry, and I'm excited to
        see where
        my career will take me.</p>
